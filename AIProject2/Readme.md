CODE INSTRUCTIONS 

Step 1. Download the following files 
- HEADER_FILE_H.h
- Heuristic1.cpp
- Heuristic2.cpp
- Heuristic3.cpp
- HeuristicJordan.cpp
- HeuristicMason.cpp
- HeuristicSarah.cpp
- main.cpp

Step 2. Once the program is downloaded and put into a compiler, run the program.

Step 3. Type in a number 1-6 to run a heuristic function with the A* algorithm 

Step 4. Look at the tables displayed and compare the measurements 

ABOUT THE PROGRAM: 
This is a program developed by my team and I to anaylize the way heuristic functions shape the outcome of A* algorithm in a AI enviornment.
